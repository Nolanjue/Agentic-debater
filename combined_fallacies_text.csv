ad hominem,"However , climate realists can make lemonade from EDF ’ s preposterous mailer by using it to show open-minded people the difference between global warming alarmists and global warming truth-tellers . EDF has assembled what it believes to be the 10 most powerful global warming assertions in the alarmists ’ playbook , yet each assertion either backfires on alarmists or has been proven false ."
intentional,"While reading how flawed EDF ’ s assertions are , remember these are the very best arguments global warming alarmists can make ."
appeal to emotion,"Global warming alarmists ’ preferred electricity source – wind power – kills nearly 1 million bats every year ( to say nothing of the more than 500,000 birds killed every year ) in the United States alone . This appalling death toll occurs every year even while wind power produces just 3 % of U.S. electricity ."
faulty generalization,"Ramping up wind power to 10 , 20 , or 30 % of U.S. electricity production would likely increase annual bat kills to 10-to-30 million every year ."
fallacy of extension,"Killing 30 million bats every year in response to dubious claims that global warming might once in a great while kill 100,000 bats makes no sense ."
intentional,"Just as importantly , alarmists present no evidence that global warming caused the summer heat wave in a notoriously hot desert near the equator . To the contrary , climate change theory and objective data show our recent global warming is occurring primarily in the winter , toward the poles , and at night ."
intentional,"Indeed , Queensland ’ s 2014 heat wave paled in comparison to the 1972 heat wave that occurred 42 years of global warming ago . If global warming caused the 2014 Queensland heat wave , why wasn ’ t it as severe as the 1972 Queensland heat wave ?"
fallacy of extension,Blaming every single summer heat wave or extreme weather event on global warming is a stale and discredited tactic in the alarmist playbook .
fallacy of extension,Alarmist attempts to frame thriving forests as harmful perfectly illustrate the alarmists ’ proclivity to claim anything and everything – no matter how beneficial – is severely harmful and caused by global warming .
faulty generalization,"Any attempts to claim global warming will cause a few more Lyme Disease deaths must be weighed against the 36,000 Americans who are killed by the flu each year ."
fallacy of logic,The alarmists ’ asserted national security threat depends on assertions that ( 1 ) global warming is causing a reduction in food and water supplies and ( 2 ) migrations of people to places with more food and water will increase risks of military conflict . Objective facts refute both assertions .
faulty generalization,"Longer growing seasons and fewer frost events also benefit plant growth and crop production . As this column has repeatedly documented ( see articles here , here , and here , for example ) , global crops set new production records virtually every year as our planet modestly warms . If crop shortages cause national security threats and global warming increases crop production , then global warming benefits rather than jeopardizes national security ."
faulty generalization,"Objective data show there has been a gradual increase in global precipitation and soil moisture as our planet warms . Warmer temperatures evaporate more water from the oceans , which in turn stimulates more frequent precipitation over continental land masses . The result of this enhanced precipitation is an improvement in soil moisture at almost all sites in the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank . If declining precipitation and declining soil moisture are military threat multipliers , than global warming is creating a safer , more peaceful world ."
fallacy of relevance,"Utilizing 20th century technologies , humans effectively adapted to global sea level rise . Utilizing 21st century technologies , humans will be even better equipped to adapt to global sea level rise ."
equivocation,"Although alarmists frequently point to a modest recent shrinkage in the Arctic ice sheet , that decline has been completely offset by ice sheet expansion in the Antarctic . Cumulatively , polar ice sheets have not declined at all since NASA satellite instruments began precisely measuring them 35 years ago . Alarmist Assertion # 5"
intentional,"As such , pollen counts will rise and fall along with plant health and vegetation intensity . Any increase in pollen will be the result of a greener biosphere with more plant growth ."
fallacy of extension,"For people experiencing an increase in vegetation in previously barren regions , this greening of the Earth is welcome and wonderful news . For global warming alarmists , however , a greener biosphere is terrible news and something to be opposed ."
fallacy of extension,"Global warming alarmists claim a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is horrible and justifies massive , economy-destroying energy restrictions ."
fallacy of extension,Global warming realists understand that a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is not a horrible thing simply because humans may have had some role in creating it .
intentional,"Objective scientific data verify winters are getting colder , which counters the key prerequisite to EDF ’ s pine beetle claim . NOAA temperature data show winter temperatures in the United States have been getting colder for at least the past two decades . Pine beetles can not be taking advantage of warmer winters if winters are in fact getting colder ."
false causality,"Pine beetles are a natural part of forest ecosystems . Expanding pine forests can support more beetles . The predictable increase in pine beetles is largely a product of , rather than a foil against , expanding pine forests ."
fallacy of extension,One can hardly argue that western pine forests are “ destroying iconic Western forests ” when western forests are becoming denser and more prevalent as the planet warms .
false causality,"Decades of over-aggressive fire suppression policies have caused an unnatural buildup of older , denser , more vulnerable pine forests . These conditions predictably aid pine beetles ."
fallacy of extension,Only global warming alarmists would claim that lusher vegetation and more abundant plant life is a bad thing .
fallacy of extension,"Playing on a general tendency for people to fear change , EDF and global warming alarmists argue that changes in the biosphere that make it richer , lusher , and more conducive to life are changes to be feared and opposed ."
fallacy of extension,"If barren ecosystems constitute an ideal planet , then the alarmist fears of more plant life make sense . On the contrary , global warming realists understand a climate more conducive to richer , more abundant plant life is beneficial rather than harmful ."
intentional,"Severe storms , floods and agricultural losses may cost a great deal of money , but such extreme weather events – and their resulting costs – are dramatically declining as the Earth modestly warms . Accordingly , EDF ’ s asserted economic costs are actually economic benefits ."
false causality,Any increase in flooding activity is due to human alterations of river and stream flow rather than precipitation changes .
false causality,"Also , the modest recent warming is producing U.S. and global crop production records virtually every year , creating billions of dollars in new economic and human welfare benefits each and every year ."
faulty generalization,Forcing the American economy to operate on expensive and unreliable wind and solar power will have tremendous negative economic consequences .
intentional,"The economic consequences of Obama ’ s global warming policies can already be seen in electricity prices , which are currently the highest in U.S. history ."
appeal to emotion,"Remarkably , Obama ’ s global warming policies are increasing electricity prices even while new natural gas discoveries , revolutionary advances in natural gas production technologies , and a dramatic resultant decline in natural gas prices would otherwise spur a dramatic decline in electricity prices ."
false causality,"For example , DDT had all but eliminated malaria in the United States and on the global stage during the mid-20th century . However , environmental activists championed false environmental accusations against DDT and dramatically reduced use of the life-saving mosquito killer throughout much of the world . As a result , malaria has reemerged with a vengeance and millions of people die every year as a result ."
fallacy of relevance,"In the United States alone , influenza kills 36,000 people every year , which dwarfs all heat-dependent viruses and diseases combined ."
fallacy of extension,"Few people other than global warming alarmists would argue that it is better to have 36,000 people die each year from influenza than have a few people die each year from Lyme Disease ( which , as documented above , isn ’ t even related to global warming ) ."
ad hominem,"Calling attention to anecdotal incidents of icebergs breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet , while deliberately ignoring the overall growth of the Antarctic ice sheet , is a misleading and favorite tactic of global warming alarmists ."
intentional,"The EDF ’ s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading . Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years , since the Earth ’ s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age . The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs ."
fallacy of extension,"Moreover , opening up more of the Earth ’ s surface to vegetation and plant and animal life would normally be considered a beneficial change , if global warming alarmists had not so thoroughly politicized the global warming discussion ."

appeal to emotion,"One 2008 study found that for every degree Celsius the temperature rises because of CO2 levels , ozone pollution can be expected to kill an additional 22,000 people via respiratory illness , asthma , and emphysema ."
appeal to emotion,"In recent years , we 've pushed those gas levels into uncharted territory . That change has inevitable and scary consequences ."
appeal to emotion,"Research indicates that if unchecked , increased CO2 levels could cause pollution-related deaths to increase by tens of thousands , and lead to the slowing of human cognition ( especially when you take into account the fact that CO2 levels tend to be higher indoors in cities ) . Carbon dioxide also contributes to warming that causes sea-level rise , searing heat waves , and superstorms ."

intentional,"Ken: There has to be an objective morality because otherwise terms like “right” and “wrong” would be meaningless since they have no foundation for comparison. 
Rob: The terms “right” and “wrong” are based on cultural norms, which do have a subjective foundation -- one that changes as the moral sphere of the culture changes.  The term “heavy” does not have an objective standard, yet we have no problem using that term in a meaningful way.  In fact, very few relational terms have any kind of objective foundation.
Ken: But without an objective morality, we would all be lost morally as a race.
Rob: Many would say that we are.
Ken: But how can you say that torturing children for fun is morally acceptable in any situation?
Rob: Personally, I wouldn’t, but you are implying that anything that is not objective must necessarily be seen in all possible ways. A feather may not be seen as “heavy” to anyone, but that doesn’t mean its “lightness” is still not relative to other objects.
Ken: But God is the standard of objective morality.  Prove that wrong!
Rob: That I cannot do.
"
intentional," Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.
